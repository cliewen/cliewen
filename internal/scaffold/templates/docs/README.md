# The corpus

This directory is the **system-of-record**: the permanent, durable truth about the system. Cliewen changes are transient deltas on branches that get **digested** into this corpus at merge — `git log docs/` is the audit trail. Entry point for humans and agents alike; agents treat this tree as working memory when a change affects product or methodology meaning. Plain changes classified by AGENTS.md stay outside the corpus.

## How the corpus is wired

Every artifact carries YAML frontmatter with a common core — `id`, `type`, `status`, `links`, `title` — plus small type-specific extensions. **Identity is the ID, the path is only the current address**: tooling discovers artifacts by scanning frontmatter, and external systems reference IDs, never paths.

The red thread `clue validate` walks:

```
G-xxx (goal) → P-xxx/M-xxx (plan/milestone) → CH-xxx (change)
  → CAP-xxx (capability) → AC-xxx (acceptance criterion) → test tag
```

Cross-cutting, checked against every proposal: C-xxx (constraints), QS-xxx (quality scenarios).

## What lives where — and when a change updates it

Each folder below holds one kind of record. A Cliewen change (the `clue-delta` loop) updates, in the same branch and PR as the code, every record its work touches:

- **Goals** (`goals/`) — who wants the system and why. A new wish enters here as `status: proposed`; a change rarely touches goals.
- **Plans** (`plans/`) — campaigns with verifiable milestones. Every Cliewen change names the plan item it serves (or declares itself plan-less); the digest updates milestone bookkeeping.
- **Capabilities** (`capabilities/`) — one folder per capability: `README.md` (what and why), `criteria.md` (acceptance criteria as Gherkin, each tied to tests), `design.md` (how it works). **Design is documented per capability** — a change that alters a capability's behavior updates its criteria and design in the same PR.
- **Architecture** (`architecture/`) — the shape of the whole: the expensive-to-change. Updated when a change alters the system's structure or public surface, not for local detail.
- **Decisions** (`decisions/`) — why things are the way they are. An **ADR** records an architectural decision, a **PDR** a decision about how the project works; both are expensive to reverse. Cheap-and-local-to-reverse decisions are one-line rows in `log.md`. Every decision made during a change is recorded in its digest.
- **Constraints** (`constraints/`) — external rules the system must not break: laws, licenses, policies. Each names its `source` and how it is `enforcement`-checked. Updated only when the outside world imposes something.
- **Quality** (`quality/`) — quality scenarios: verifiable non-functional requirements. Updated when a change introduces or moves a quality bar.
- **Analysis** (`analysis/`) — findings from spikes and extractions. Historical records: written once, never rewritten.

## Status vocabularies

**The default lifecycle is `draft` → `active` → `retired`.** It applies to every artifact type, including your own — a type `clue validate` does not recognize is validated against this default, so you can add your own artifact types under `docs/` without changing the tool. Only the types below differ, each for a stated reason.

| Type | Statuses | Why not the default |
|---|---|---|
| goal | `proposed` → `accepted` → `retired` | proposed goals are the inbox |
| plan | `draft` → `active` → `completed` | `completed` is immutable |
| decision | `inferred` → `verified` | provenance lives in status; human acceptance promotes |
| log | `active` | one register — rows are its lifecycle |
| change, tasks | `open` | transient workspace artifacts |
| open-questions | `open` → `resolved` | transient workspace artifacts |
